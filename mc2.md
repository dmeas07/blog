# Mini Challenge 2

## Override the built-in registration templates for password change form and password change done.

The files in question must match the following naming convention:

```
registration/password_change_form.html
registration/password_change_done.html
```

### Instructions
1. Create both files in the same path, with the same name.
2. The password change form template must be a form so it must follow the same `recipe` we've used for forms in the past.
3. The password change done screen is just a confirmation screen that the operation was successful.
3.1. Add an anchor tag that lets a user go to the home page after a successful password change.
