# Mini Challenge 1

### Build a blog application

#### Instructions
Create a blog project that includes the following apps:
1. pages
2. posts
3. accounts

Additionally, we should have the following views (and corresponding url patterns):
1. Home (should map to /)
2. About (should map to about/)
3. List (of posts, should map to posts/)
4. Detail (of posts, should map to posts/<id>/)
5. New (of posts, should map to posts/new/)

Finally, make sure you have all necessary jinja2 templates and that all of your views
are accessible through the development server (IE http://127.0.0.1:8000/posts/, etc)
